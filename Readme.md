# PitchPerfect
Pitch Perfect allows users to record their voice using a deviceâ€™s microphone and then play back the recording with six different sound effects: Slow, Fast, Chipmunk, Darth Vader, Fast with Reverb, and Echo.

## Usage
The main view has a microphone button that can be tapped to start recording your voice.  When you are done recording, press the stop button beneath the microphone button.

When a recording is successful, the app will take you to a new view with six buttons.  Tapping a button will play back your recording with the corresponding sound effect.
